Hello world!
I do my first steps and it looks very difficult thing for me, more difficult than JS lessons. I tried for 2 hours do this task with VS Code and few times i got into a rut, tried to solve some problems with Discord chat. Than i decided to do this task in easier way with github because deadline is close.
